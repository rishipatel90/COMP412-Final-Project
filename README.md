# COMP412-Final-Project
The Simple Java Calculator code was originally forked from the following repository: https://github.com/pH-7/Simple-Java-Calculator.

Our Simple Java Calculator can be used for quick calculations with a user-friendly design and interface. Users can make traditional addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division calculations, or if higher level calculations need to be made, we’ve implemented the ability to make Sine, Cosine, Tangent, Square, Square Root, Log, and others.

On the original program, the user interface of the calculator wasn’t user-friendly. The zero button didn’t work, and there wasn’t a decimal or Backspace button. The calculators keys were organized in a way that users aren’t accustomed to, requiring users to search longer than normal for a specific button.

The functionality we added to our version of the project was: 

1.Remove the default decimal so it doesn’t show when the output is a whole number

2.Created a two-line display: when a user clicks on an operation button, the previous value moves to the upper line of the display

3.Reorganization of the keys 

4.Make the zero key functional

5.Created and enabled a decimal button, and a backspace button

To download and run our version of the Simple Java Calculator, a user should download the files, and run the SimpleJavaCalculator.java file from the command line.

For developers, feel free to fork the files and add additional functionality and add a pull request for our team to review the changes before a merge is made.
